This is the NEW version of the Nova Reference. The main change is that this version adds sheets for some of the resource types that replace RID's with names, and parse things like weapon/outfit quantities into a sensible format. Also added is a calculation of the total space in a ship and a sheet showing the the chance of jamming vs. jamvuln and target ship jamming.
Enjoy, all
