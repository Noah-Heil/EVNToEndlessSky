Nova Reference Plus is an XLS export of most of the data in EVN. Since evnparse gets 100% of the data, it is not used for anything in particular. However, it can be useful to sanity check values. It was created by Azratax (Azratax@aznt.com, AIM: Azratax), and has no declared license.

ID.formulas is a simple document that says how some of the more obscure ID's line up. For example, the ID of the dësc matching an oütf resource. It has no declared license, but is by Adam "Blackdog" (blackdog7@prodigy.net).
