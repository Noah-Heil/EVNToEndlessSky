This uses the ship's UpCompressY and DnCompressY                      fields to interpolate the proper sprite frame to display                      based on the ship's actual heading.

The only exception is that having both flags             0x0001 and 0x0002 set is treated specially - it results in             a <a href="ship.html">sh&iuml;p</a> whose extra frames are used for banking and which             always displays its engine glow when it is turning, whether             or not it is actually accelerating.

Note that The "Gun" "Beam" etc.      designations are for convenience only, since which set of      weapon exit points is used by a given weapon are defined in      that weapon's ExitType field. The x & y positions of each       weapon exit point are measured in pixels from the center of the        <a href="ship.html">sh&iuml;p</a> when the <a href="ship.html">sh&iuml;p</a> is pointing straight up (frame index 0).

If the <a href="ship.html">sh&iuml;p</a> is     pointing generally "up" (heading is 0-90 or 270-359) then                UpCompressX/Y are used; if the <a href="ship.html">sh&iuml;p</a> is pointing generally                "down" (heading is 91-269 degrees) then DnCompressX/Y are used.                These values are divided by 100 and then multiplied by the                rotated x & y values in the weapon exit point fields to apply a                rough correction factor, so values less that 100 will bring                the exit points in closer to the <a href="ship.html">sh&iuml;p</a> and values greater than                100 will move the exit points farther out. Experimentation is                the best way to learn how this works. Values of zero are                interpreted the same as a value of 100, so you can leave                this field set to zero if unused.<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">GunPosZ<br>TurretPosZ<br>GuidedPosZ<br>BeamPosZ        <td>Here you can set further weapon exit point offsets in order to      compensate for skew caused by the z position of a ship      graphic's weapon exit point.
