Therefore, when a field in the Nova datafile is said to refer to a government, stellar object, etc., it refers to it byits index number (starts at 0) unless it is specifically stated that it isreferring to the ID number, which starts at 128.</p><p>Some of Nova's fields refer to other resource IDs or index numbers,but their values are offset by a certain amount to indicate type. For example,the <a href="misn.html">m&iuml;sn</a> resource's AvailStel field refers to the index number of a g&ouml;vtresource when its value is between 10000 and 10255. In cases like this, it isnecessary to add to or subtract from the field in order to force the value intothe proper range: in this instance, you'd subtract 10000 to find the indexnumber of the <a href="govt.html">g&ouml;vt</a>.</p><p>Any resources in an Nova plugin file automatically replacesame-numbered resources in Nova's main files. Resources are loaded from the"Nova Files" folder first and then resources from the "Nova Plug-Ins" folder areloaded.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><br><table width="86%" align="center">	<tr>		<td align="left" width="200"><a href="constants.html"><b>&lt;&lt;</b> Game Constants</a>		<td align="center"><a href="contents.html"><b>Table of Contents</b></a>		<td align="right" width="200"><a href="bits.html">Bits and Expressions <b>&gt;&gt;</b></a>	</tr></table><p align="center">(&copy;) 2000-2002 by Matt Burch and Ambrosia Software, Inc.</p>	</head></html>
