Set to -1 for no independent news.</table>  <p>Some notes:</p><p>1. Setting any of the above date fields to 0 or -1 effectively makes that   field a wildcard field, which will match to anything.</p><p>2. If you want an event with a wide possible date range to be guaranteed to   never run more than once, make it set a control bit in its OnEnd script that   will prevent it from subsequently being eligible for activation.</p><p>3. The 'M' and 'N' control bit set string operators should probably not be used   in conjunction with cr&ouml;n events, unless you really want to confuse the   player by moving him around at seemingly random times.</p><p>4. Local news always takes precedence over independent news, even if there is   no corresponding news string to display (the STR# ID must still be greater   than zero to not be ignored). You can use this to make everyone in the   universe except a particular government or set of governments report on   something, for example.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><br><table width="86%" align="center">	<tr>		<td align="left" width="200"><a href="colr.html"><b>&lt;&lt;</b> C&ouml;lr</a>		<td align="center"><a href="contents.html"><b>Table of Contents</b></a>		<td align="right" width="200"><a href="desc.html">D&euml;sc <b>&gt;&gt;</b></a>	</tr></table><p align="center">(&copy;) 2000-2002 by Matt Burch and Ambrosia Software, Inc.</p>	</head></html>
