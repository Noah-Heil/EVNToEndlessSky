For some d&euml;sc resources, Nova looks for acertain reserved ID number. Other d&euml;sc resources are pointed to by fields inother resources, so their ID numbers are not necessarily fixed, and can be setto virtually anything by the scenario designer. The reserved d&euml;sc ID numbers,along with the maximum length for each type, are below:</p><table><tr valign="top"><td class="colone">128-2175        <td>Stellar object descriptions, shown when landed on a planet. <tr valign="top"><td class="colone">3000-3511       <td>Outfit item descriptions, shown in <a href="ship.html">sh&iuml;p</a> outfitting dialog.<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">4000-4999       <td>Mission descriptions, shown in mission dialog. <tr valign="top"><td class="colone">13000-13767     <td><a href="ship.html">Sh&iuml;p</a> class descriptions, shown in the shipyard and                 requisition-escort dialog. <tr valign="top"><td class="colone">13999           <td>Message shown after the player uses an escape pod.<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">14000-14767     <td><a href="ship.html">Sh&iuml;p</a> pilot descriptions, shown in the hire-escort dialog. <tr valign="top"><td class="colone">32760-32767     <td>Reserved</table><p>If you wish, you can make a d&euml;sc resource mutable via control bits - embedding aspecial sequence of characters into the d&euml;sc resource will instruct Nova tochange the contents of the text on the fly. This sequence is delimited (marked)by the characters "{" and "}", and follows this format:</p><p><b>{bXXX "string one" "string two"}</b></p><p>Where "XXX" is be replaced by the index of the control bit you wish to test. Youcan add in a "!" character before the "bXXX" test in order to negate the resultof the test, but unlike the control bit test strings, you cannot performcompound tests in a d&euml;sc resource - i.e., no testing of multiple bits at a time.</p><p>If the bit test (after being negated, if the "!" character is present) evaluatesto true, the first string will be substituted in place of all the charactersbetween (and including) the "{" and "}" characters. If the bit test evaluates tofalse and there is a second string in the expression, that second string will besubstituted. If there is no second string, nothing will be substituted.</p><p>For example, consider this d&euml;sc resource:</p><p><b>This is a {b001 "great and terrific" "lousy, terrible"} example.</b></p><p>...if bit 001 is set, the output will be "This is a great and terrific example."If bit 001 is not set, the output will be "This is a lousy, terrible example.".</p><p>Also note that if you want to include a quotation mark (") character in eitherof the two strings, use standard C syntax to do it:</p><p><b>My name is {b002 "Dave \"pipeline\" Williams"}</b></p><p>This is also works with the player's gender - for example:</p><p><b>This is a test string and the player is {G "a male character" "a female pilot"}.</b></p><p>...in this case, the G character signifies that the following text is mutablebased on the player's gender; if the player is male, the first string is used,otherwise the second string is used. Note that the "!" token works here asusual.</p><p>You can also change the text based on whether or not the player is registered:</p><p><b>This is a test string you {P "have paid" "haven't paid"}.</b></p><p>...in this case, the P character signifies that the following text is mutablebased on whether or not the game is registered; if the player has registered,the first string is used, otherwise the second string is used. Note that the"!" token works here as usual, and you can also append a number to the Pcharacter to specify a number of days, just as you can with the ncb Pxxxtest operator.</p><p>Besides the Description field in the d&euml;sc resource, there are some additionalfields:</p><table><tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Graphic        <td>This is used to include graphics in mission briefings.
