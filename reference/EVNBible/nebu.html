These images don't actuallyhave any effect on events in the game, they're just there to look pretty. Youcan, however, combine n&euml;bu background images with custom asteroid orinterference data in the <a href="syst.html">s&yuml;st</a> resources for cool localized effects, and you canalso use the n&euml;bu resource's OnExplore field to enable events when the playerexplores a certain nebula.</p><p>The PICT resources associated with the 32 available n&euml;bu resources are numbered9500-9724. Each nebula can have up to seven PICT resources associated with it;the first nebula's PICTs are 9500-96, the second's are 9507-13, etc. The enginewill pick the best nebula image to display for a given map scale (the map scalesused in Nova are 42.1%, 56.2%, 75.0%, 100.0%, 133.3%, 177.7%, and 237.0%). If anebula image of the proper size for the current map scale isn't available, Novawill pick the closest one and stretch it as necessary. PICTs for a given nebulashould be sorted by size in ascending order.</p><p>The effects of the n&euml;bu resource's fields are as follows:</p><table><tr valign="top"><td class="colone">XPos     <td>The image's position on the star map. These coordinates are<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">YPos       <td>expressed in the scale of the "normal" map zoom level (not zoomed           in or out) and are relative to the upper-left corner of the image.<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">XSize    <td>The image's size on the star map. These values are expressed in<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">YSize      <td>the scale of the "normal" map zoom level (not zoomed in or out) and           tell Nova how big to make the image when the map is at normal           zoom.<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">ActiveOn   <td>Control bit test expression. Leave blank if unused. <tr valign="top"><td class="colone">OnExplore  <td>Control bit set expression that is evaluated whenever the nebula is            tested for visibility and found to be visible. Note that this field            is handled a little differently from other control bit set            expressions in Nova, because the explored state of the nebulae            isn't saved from game to game; rather, it is recalculated every            time based on the systems the player has explored. As a result,            this expression may get evaluated multiple times, so you shouldn't            use the random operator or any operators which do anything but            set or clear control bits here.</table></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><br><table width="86%" align="center">	<tr>		<td align="left" width="200"><a href="misn.html"><b>&lt;&lt;</b> M&iuml;sn</a>		<td align="center"><a href="contents.html"><b>Table of Contents</b></a>		<td align="right" width="200"><a href="oops.html">&Ouml;ops <b>&gt;&gt;</b></a>	</tr></table><p align="center">(&copy;) 2000-2002 by Matt Burch and Ambrosia Software, Inc.</p>	</head></html>
