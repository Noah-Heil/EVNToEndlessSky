This time around,there are 10,000 bits available for your use, and they are accessed muchdifferently from previous versions. For this reason, they are referred to asNova control bits (ncb's). Control bits are accessed through logical expressionsthat allow much more powerful and logical mission scripting. These expressions aredivided into two types - test and set:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="hr" align="center"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="large">Test expressions:</p><p>These are boolean expressions that are used to determine when something happens;for example, when a mission is to be offered, or when a particular <a href="ship.html">sh&iuml;p</a> shouldbe made available for purchase. In general, if the logical expression defined ina given test expression field evaluates to be true (nonzero), the associatedproperty will be activated (mission becomes available, <a href="ship.html">sh&iuml;p</a> appears, etc.).</p><p>The following terms and operators are supported: (capitalization doesn't matter)</p><table><tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Bxxx    <td>Lookup the value of control bit xxx. Bits are numbered from b0 to b9999.<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Pxxx    <td>Check if the game is registered ([P]aid for) ... evaluates to 1 ifthe game is registered or is unregistered but less than xxx days haveelapsed. Evaluates to 0 only if unregistered for more than xxx days.<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">G    <td>Lookup the player's gender - 1 if male, 0 if female<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Oxxx    <td>Returns 1 if the player has at least one of outfit item ID xxx, 0 if not<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Exxx    <td>Returns 1 if the player has explored system ID xxx, 0 if not<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">|    <td>Logical or operator<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">&amp;    <td>Logical and operator<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">!    <td>Logical negation operator<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">( )    <td>Parenthetical enclosure</table><p>Some examples:<br><b>b13 & (b15 | !b72)</b><br><b>!(B42 | B53) & b103</b></p><p>Note that since the Nova evaluator is fairly primitive, it may do unpredictablethings if you give it an expression like b1 & b2 | b3 ... instead, use properparentheses to make it b1 & (b2 | b3) or (b1 & b2) | b3, as appropriate.</p><p>Also note that if you leave the field for a test expression blank, it willevaluate to true as a default.</p><p>Also also note:  The Oxxx operator also considers any carried fighters that aredeployed when it examines the player's current list of outfits, although thisfeature may be confused if presented with a universe that includes multiplefighter bay weapons that launch the same <a href="ship.html">sh&iuml;p</a> type, or different outfits thatgrant the same fighter bay ammo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="hr" align="center"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="large">Set expressions:</p><p>These are simpler than the test expressions... basically all you are doing hereis listing what bits you want to be modified when the expression in a givenfield is invoked. This will happen when the player does something (completes amission, buys an item, etc.) as defined by the other resources. The syntax ofset expressions is best illustrated by an example:</p><p><b>b1 b2 !b3 ^b4</b></p><p>In this set expression, bits 1 and 2 will be set, bit 3 will be cleared, and bit4 will be toggled to the opposite of whatever it was previously. No parenthesesare supported for set expressions. Note that if you leave a set expressionblank, no control bits will be altered.</p><p>One other feature of the set expression is the ability to make random decisions.By specifying   R(&gt;op1&lt; &gt;op2&lt;)   you can make Nova randomly pick one of the twopossible choices and execute it, skipping the other one. For example:</p><p><b>b1 R(b2 !b3)</b></p><p>...this expression will set bit 1, and then *either* set bit 2 *or* clear bit 3,but not both at once. Which operation will be picked is completely random, whichallows for the design of interesting mission strings that branch unpredictably.</p><p>There are also a number of other operators that allow you to do many interestingthings:</p><table><tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Axxx     <td>if mission ID xxx is currently active, abort it.<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Fxxx     <td>if mission ID xxx is currently active, cause it to fail.<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Sxxx     <td>start mission ID xxx automatically.<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Gxxx     <td>grant one of outfit item ID xxx to the player<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Dxxx     <td>remove (Delete) one of outfit item ID xxx from the player<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Mxxx     <td>move the player to system xxx.
