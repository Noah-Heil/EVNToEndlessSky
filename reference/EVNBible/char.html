The player is presented with a list of all available ch&auml;rresources when a new pilot is created, and must choose one (but only one). Thisallows different character types to have different ships, legal records, etc. atthe start of the game, and also allows for the setting-up of mission stuff byway of a control bit set string that is evaluated when a new pilot is started.</p><table><tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Cash          <td>The amount of money a player gets when starting out with this               character type                <tr valign="top"><td class="colone">ShipType      <td>ID number of the starting <a href="ship.html">sh&iuml;p</a> type<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">System1-4     <td>ID numbers of up to four possible starting systems for the               player.
