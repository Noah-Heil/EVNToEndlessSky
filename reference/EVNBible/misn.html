This is useful for when the mission cargo is a      proper name.</p><p><b>Note:</b> When Nova selects a random mission destination, it attempts to ensure      that the random destination is: a) more than two hyper jumps away from      the system where the mission is being offered, and b) a stellar which      is guaranteed to always exist throughout the course of the game,      regardless of system swapping. This means that if you have multiple      systems that occupy the same coordinates at different times in the game      and not all of them contain stellar object X, no missions will use      stellar object X as their random destination. (This is to keep the      player from accepting a mission with a random destination that might      cease to exist before he gets there!) A further important consequence      of this restriction is that if Nova detects that a mission whose      TravelStel or ReturnStel is to be randomly selected will violate this      rule, it will be prevented from being offered regardless of any other      availability parameters the mission might have - i.e. if you create a      mission and Nova refuses to make it available, check the debug log      to see if the mission couldn't find a suitable nontransient random      stellar of the desired characteristics.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><br><table width="86%" align="center">	<tr>		<td align="left" width="200"><a href="intf.html"><b>&lt;&lt;</b> &Iuml;ntf</a>		<td align="center"><a href="contents.html"><b>Table of Contents</b></a>		<td align="right" width="200"><a href="nebu.html">N&euml;bu <b>&gt;&gt;</b></a>	</tr></table><p align="center">(&copy;) 2000-2002 by Matt Burch and Ambrosia Software, Inc.</p>	</head></html>
