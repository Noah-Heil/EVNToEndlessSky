Each system can be linked to up to 16 othersystems, and the player can make hyperspace jumps back and forth between them.System ID #128 also has a special significance: that system is where the playerstarts out when first beginning the game and if he subsequently ejects and isrescued. This system should always be made neutral, so the player isn't pursuedby big beefy ships when he's just starting out.</p><p>The first two fields in the s&yuml;st resource tell Nova where on the map to placeit:</p><table><tr valign="top"><td class="colone">xPos & yPos     <td>The system's X and Y positions on the map</table><p>The next fields store the hyperspace links to up to 16 other systems</p><table><tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Con1-Con16     <td>Link to another system<br>              <b>-1</b> - No link<br>               <b>128-1127</b> - ID of a system to link to</table><p>The next fields store the stellar navigation defaults (F1-F4 for the first four)for the system. It is important to always set navigation defaults for stellarobjects in your systems, because that's how Nova's AI routines and statusdisplay keep track of stellar objects; if you don't set a planet as a navdefault, the AIs won't "see" it, it won't show up on the radar, and you can'tselect it.</p><table><tr valign="top"><td class="colone">NavDef (x16)         <td>Navigation defaults (F1-F4)<br>                    <b>-1</b> - No nav default for this key<br>                     <b>128-548</b> - ID number of the stellar object to set as a                                   default</table><p>The next fields tell Nova how many ships, and of what kind, to put in thesystem:</p><table><tr valign="top"><td class="colone">DudeTypes (x8)          <td>Which type of <a href="dude.html">d&uuml;de</a> to place (best not to set this to                          an out-of-range value)<br>                        <b>128 to 639</b> - ID number of the <a href="dude.html">d&uuml;de</a> type to place<br>                        <b>-128 to -639</b> - ID number of a fleet type to place<br>                        <b>-1</b> - unused<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">% Prob (x8)             <td>Probability that a given ship/fleet placed is of each of                          the above types<br>                        <b>1-99</b> - This percent probability<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">AvgShips                <td>The average number of AI ships in the system<br>                        <b>0</b> - No ships, empty system<br>                        <b>1 and up</b> - This number of ships, +/- 50%</table><p>The next field tells Nova who controls the system:</p><table><tr valign="top"><td class="colone"><a href="govt.html">G&ouml;vt</a>                    <td>Which government owns the system<br>                        <b>-1</b> - Ignored (system is independent)<br>                         <b>128-383</b> - ID number of the controlling govt</table><p>The next tells Nova which string, if any, to display as the message buoy'smessage when you enter a system:</p><table><tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Message                 <td>Which message buoy string to display<br>                        <b>-1</b> - Ignored (no special message)<br>                         <b>1 and up</b> - Use this entry in STR# resource 1000 as                                        the text of the message buoy</table><p>The next two fields tell Nova what kinds of navigation hazards to put in thesystem:</p><table><tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Asteroids               <td>How many asteroids to put in the system, from 0 to 16<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Interference            <td>How thick the static in the system should be. 0 is no                          static, 100 is complete sensor blackout.</table><p>Want to make a 'pers' type <a href="ship.html">sh&iuml;p</a> always appear? Put its ID into one of the Personfields that appear at the end of the s&yuml;st resource.</p><p>The Visibility field controls how and when to make the system visible orinvisible. You can pull off some cool tricks with this field, includingpresenting the illusion that system has changed in some way by hiding theoriginal system and replacing it with a copy that is identical except for thedesired changes. The Visibility field is a control bit test expression - leaveit blank if unused.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Using the Visibility field to replace one system with another will workfine as long as they have the exact same coordinates (that's how Nova knowsto update the hyper links, etc.)  But, if you're going to have systemsreplacing each other in response to ncb changes, be sure that the Visibilityfields of all the systems are mutually exclusive, or the resulting behaviorwill be undefined and probably incorrect.</p><table><tr valign="top"><td class="colone">BkgndColor     <td>The system's background color, encoded the same as HTML colors.                 (RRGGBB)  ...set to zero for pure black.<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Murk           <td>The murkiness of the system (0-100).

A value less than zero                 is equivalent to zero murk but also hides the starfield.<tr valign="top"><td class="colone">AstTypes       <td>Flag bits that determine what types of asteroids will appear               in this system:<br>               <span class="hex">0x0001</span> - Small metal   (<a href="roid.html">r&ouml;id</a> ID 128)<br>               <span class="hex">0x0002</span> - Medium metal  (<a href="roid.html">r&ouml;id</a> ID 129)<br>               <span class="hex">0x0004</span> - Large metal   (<a href="roid.html">r&ouml;id</a> ID 130)<br>               <span class="hex">0x0008</span> - Huge metal    (<a href="roid.html">r&ouml;id</a> ID 131)<br>               <span class="hex">0x0010</span> - Small ice     (<a href="roid.html">r&ouml;id</a> ID 132)<br>               <span class="hex">0x0020</span> - Medium ice    (<a href="roid.html">r&ouml;id</a> ID 133)<br>               etc.                <tr valign="top"><td class="colone">ReinfFleet     <td>The ID of a fleet to use as this system's reinforcement fleet.                 If ships allied with the reinforcement fleet's government are                 under attack and the combat odds against them exceed the                 MaxOdds field of the reinforcement fleet's government, the                 reinforcement fleet will be called in.
