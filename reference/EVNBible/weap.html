The name ofthe w&euml;ap resource is used as the weapon name in the weaponry section of thestatus display. The first two fields control the duration of different aspectsof the weapon:</p><table><tr valign="top"><td class="colone">Reload                  <td>The number of frames it takes for one of this weapon to                          reload. 30 = 1 shot/sec.

Energy damage does damage toshields only, and mass damage does damage to armor only.
