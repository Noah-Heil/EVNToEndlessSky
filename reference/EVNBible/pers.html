These AI-people havetheir names (which are also the names of the associated p&euml;rs resource) displayedon the target-info display in place of the name of their <a href="ship.html">sh&iuml;p</a> class. When shipsare created, there is a 5% chance that a specific AI-person will also becreated. (obviously, as AI-people are killed off, they cease to appear in thegame.)
